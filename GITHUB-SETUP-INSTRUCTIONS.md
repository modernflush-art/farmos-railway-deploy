# üìù GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Your code is ready for GitHub! Follow these steps to create your repository and connect it:

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**: Visit https://github.com
2. **Login** to your GitHub account
3. **Create New Repository**:
   - Click the **"+"** button in the top right
   - Select **"New repository"**
4. **Repository Settings**:
   - **Repository name**: `farmos-railway-deploy` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: `FarmOS application with PostgreSQL ready for Railway deployment`
   - **Visibility**: Choose **Public** or **Private**
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository

After creating the GitHub repository, you'll see a page with setup instructions. Use the **"push an existing repository"** section:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace with YOUR details)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Run the Deployment Script

Once connected to GitHub, run:
```bash
./deploy-to-railway.sh
```

## Example Commands

If your GitHub username is `john` and you named your repository `farmos-app`:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/john/farmos-app.git
git push -u origin main
```

## ‚úÖ What's Ready for GitHub

Your repository includes:
- ‚úÖ FarmOS application code
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL database configuration
- ‚úÖ Railway deployment files
- ‚úÖ Docker configuration
- ‚úÖ Deployment scripts
- ‚úÖ Complete documentation

## üöÄ Next Steps After GitHub Setup

1. **Create Railway project** from your GitHub repository
2. **Add PostgreSQL database** in Railway
3. **Deploy and configure** your application

Your code is fully prepared for Railway deployment!
