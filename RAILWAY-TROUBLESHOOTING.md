# üîß Railway Deployment Troubleshooting

## ‚úÖ Healthcheck Issue - FIXED!

I've just pushed fixes for the healthcheck failure you encountered. Here's what was fixed:

### Changes Made:
1. **Enhanced Healthcheck Endpoint**: Created robust `/health.php` endpoint
2. **Extended Timeout**: Increased healthcheck timeout to 600 seconds
3. **Added Grace Period**: 180-second grace period for startup
4. **Improved Configuration**: Better Railway deployment settings

### What to Expect:
- Railway will automatically start a new deployment
- The new deployment should pass health checks
- Application should be accessible once deployment completes

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Monitor New Deployment
- Watch the Railway dashboard for the new deployment
- Look for "DEPLOYING" status to change to "SUCCESS"
- The healthcheck should now pass

### 2. Add PostgreSQL Database (if not done yet)
1. In Railway dashboard, click **"New Service"**
2. Select **"Database"** ‚Üí **"PostgreSQL"**
3. Wait for database deployment

### 3. Test Your Application
Once deployment succeeds:
- Visit your Railway app URL
- You should see FarmOS installation page
- Complete the setup using Railway's database credentials

## üîç Common Railway Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Build Failures
**Solution**: Check build logs in Railway dashboard
- Look for dependency issues
- Ensure Dockerfile syntax is correct

### Issue: Database Connection Errors
**Solution**: 
- Ensure PostgreSQL service is running
- Check environment variables are set
- Install required PostgreSQL extensions

### Issue: Slow Startup
**Solution**: 
- FarmOS/Drupal applications can take 2-3 minutes to fully start
- The healthcheck now allows for this with extended timeouts

### Issue: Memory Issues
**Solution**:
- Monitor resource usage in Railway dashboard
- Consider upgrading Railway plan if needed

## üìä Monitoring Your Deployment

### Railway Dashboard Features:
- **Build Logs**: See compilation process
- **Deploy Logs**: Monitor application startup
- **Metrics**: CPU, memory, network usage
- **Environment Variables**: Database connection details

### Health Check Endpoint:
- **URL**: `https://your-app.railway.app/health.php`
- **Expected Response**: "OK - FarmOS Application Healthy"
- **Use**: Verify application is running properly

## üÜò If Issues Persist

### Check These:
1. **Railway Logs**: Look for error messages
2. **Database Status**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running
3. **Environment Variables**: Verify database connection settings
4. **Resource Limits**: Check if hitting memory/CPU limits
